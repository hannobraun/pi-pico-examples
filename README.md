# Embedded Examples

## About

This repository was supposed to provide examples of Embedded Rust applications
using the Raspberry Pi Pico, to augment a website I was building. Then my plans
changed, and I ended up focusing on other things.

This repository now contains all the code I had for this, but I'm not going to
expand on it.
